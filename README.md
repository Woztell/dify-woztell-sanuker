### Using the tool

You can use the WOZTELL tool in the following application types:

#### Chatflow / Workflow applications

Both Chatflow and Workflow applications support adding a WOZTELL tool node.

#### Create workflow

![workflow3](./_assets/woztell_5.png)

#### Search WOZTELL

![workflow4](./_assets/woztell_6.png)

Within this list, you will find all nodes developed by WOZTELL for Dify. You may directly drag and drop the required node into the workflow designer to make it part of your workflow.

BOT API Tools: These nodes provide your workflow with the ability to send messages and perform data operations through WOZTELL products.

Member Tools: These nodes allow you to efficiently manage all member information stored within WOZTELL products.

#### Node: Send Response

Using the **Send Response** node, you can directly send messages from your WhatsApp Business number to the target customer’s WhatsApp account via the WOZTELL BotAPI. All message content can be placed directly within the Response data.

Once the message is sent, you will receive the corresponding API result, which allows subsequent nodes to continue processing the data.

For more details, please refer to the official WOZTELL product documentation: [https://doc.woztell.com/docs/reference/bot-api-reference#send-responses](https://doc.woztell.com/docs/reference/bot-api-reference#send-responses)

#### Node: Redirect member to node

With the **Redirect Member to Node** node, you no longer need to manually construct complex JSON data for sending messages. Instead, you simply pass the relevant WOZTELL information to a **Chatbot Tree** node, and the WOZTELL Chatbot will handle the subsequent actions for you — such as sending WhatsApp conversation message templates.

This node can be understood as a memory pointer: it redirects the current operation to the WOZTELL Chatbot. You do not need to prepare complicated data structures; you only need to initiate a request to the BotAPI.

For customers who already have chatbot designs running on the WOZTELL platform, this provides an excellent way to integrate with Dify.
